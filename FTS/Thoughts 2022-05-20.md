 - was reading last night that Niantic changed the remote raid pass price, and is removing it from the weekly bundles. They are increasing rewards from in person raids. They have not reduced damage from remote raids.
- we need to grocery shop.
- I was also reading yesterday evening Lady Althea’s newsletter from some days ago that the eclipse was hitting her hard. and I wondered if my putting in for TL was a result of that setup or maybe I should say that the position was available, as. I was thinking about moving up to a TL before that. 
- It has been wired to have so many people from the department ask have I started as digital TL. It was also very good feeling to hear Pam say that. I was a good choice. during my interview.
- Went to buy dinner and realized I didn't have my cards with me. They must be in the shorts I was wearing this morning and I forgot to switch them to the new I bought on lunch. Went to the car to look for the cars and the bag with the shorts was not in it. I must have left them at work.
- [[Tanner]] is here until sometime on Sunday
