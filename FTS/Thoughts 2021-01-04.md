- Called out, no motivations
- It’s snowing some tonight. I’ve been watching [[CSI]], catching up on the seasons I missed. It is still good. I am greatly enjoying [[Laurence Fishburn]] in this show.
- I’ve also been watching [[Big Sky]]. It’s not too bad. 
- [[Star Trek Discovery]] is another show that I am enjoying.
