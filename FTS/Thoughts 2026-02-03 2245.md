[[WoW]] has not run well the last several times I've tried in Linux.I ordered a 2TB HDD to install Linux on hoping that actually solves my issues. If it doesn't then I'll bee dual booting to play the game. I don't think I want to stop playing. 

Need to figure out [[Hledger]] and using the ledger file in [[Obsidian]] as the plugin isn't working correctly. I don't know if that's user error or the plugin not being updated in 2 yrs. Fuck did that effect me still. I made a wi rebel alliance sticker for my ipad case. I used the label printer.
