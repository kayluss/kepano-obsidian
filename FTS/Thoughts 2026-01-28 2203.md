Spent 2 - 3 hours figuring out how to install Zorin OS on the seagate external drive. I got [[Palia]] and [[WoW]] to run. Wow was smoother than Palia. I was not expecting that. Next is researching how to use addons. I need to find the install folder of Wow.
I can start learning terminal and neovim. I do need to figure out a better way to file share between linux and ipad.

Local Send app try tomorrow after fixing app store lockout.
