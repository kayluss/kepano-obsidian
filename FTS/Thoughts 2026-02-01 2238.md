It’s snowing out which means its much warmer. We might even see above freezing this week.
It’s really a [[dysphoric]] period this month. I am thinking about doing a 2025 political timeline note. The [[Minnesota Resistance Symbol]] is sadly cool. How fucked up is it that we have a resistance symbol?  Some how I found the wow installation folder for addons. I hope gettng a new HDD solves the unplayable status of the game. even if it does not I still want a larger HDD over the 1tb SSD.
