  - I snagged some new games over the summer. [Ssx3](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00009X3VB/qid=1091915491/sr=8-2/ref=pd_ka_2/103-4663076-8449457?v=glance&s=videogames&n=507846) wasn't one that I orginially wanted but Randi wanted it and I dont refuse her. Well it turns out she had good gaming instinct with this one. Both of us had played it everyday for the past month. The graphics and controls are superb the only thing I didn't like about it is you can't board everywhere. :(
        - [Star Wars Rogue Leader : Rogue Squadron II](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00005QDPZ/qid=1091916108/sr=10-1/ref=sr_10_1/103-4663076-8449457?v=glance&s=videogames) has quickly jumped to my favorite game on the gamecube. As a fan of the movies this game puts me in the movies.
        - [Defender](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/stores/detail/-/videogames/B00006ZCCL/qid=1091916044/sr=2-2/ref=sr_2_2/103-4663076-8449457) is the other game I am playing. Though the fact the you constantly have to tap the forward thruster button is greatly annoying this game ok for a starfighter game.
        - Finding Nemo game is simple and a nice meditation game. My nephews being 6 and 4 love it.
