I’m getting the hang of the menu system at work, which is good. Mike n Jazz stopped and visited for a bit as they had packed the last of three stuff needed to move into there new place in [[Nekoosa]]. I migrated a few more notes into this new system. Oh, it warmed enough that I could finally get my trunk open today. The notebook I was looking for yesterday was in the trunk. 
 I stayed and extra 20 mins cause it was just busy and they needed help. There was also some kind of visit which the shift passed with a 93. 
I think I want to shave my head again.
