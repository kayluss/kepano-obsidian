        - I have been up for the last hour, I'm still having cramps. I could not get to sleep last night lots of [[pain]] and my mind would not shut off enough. I hate my period. I called out for today, good thing I did. Today is a be gentle with myself day. I have low energy and my mind has a million things it wants to get done.

	- I had a moment of realization that [[I am a product of my time, generation]]. I do not need to abandon paper. I was born in the period before the Internet. I am accustomed to phonebooks, cable tv, handwritten notes, letters with postage, catalogs, mail ordering before amazon. I also am accustomed to email, contact lists, social media. I can navigate both, and use the useful parts.
	- I have noticed the days before I start [[menses]], I tend to avoid lots of thinking. Thinking kicks into high gear on the day after all the physical pain happens
