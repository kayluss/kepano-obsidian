This also unlocks Twilight's Blade World Quests in the Twilight Highlands area for your Warband.

## Twilight Ascension Pre-Patch Event

Completing the main questline for the pre-patch grants access to a variety of activities in the Twilight Highlands: Twilight's Blade World Quests and Twilight's Blade Rare spawns. Participating in these will earn you [Twilight's Blade Insignia](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/currency=3319/twilights-blade-insignia), which can be used to purchase rewards from the pre-patch event. Completing activities in the Twilight Highlands awards the following amounts of Twilight's Blade Insignias:

World Quests refresh every 12 hours and follow the standard World Quest system. The Rares summoned by the Twilight's Blade, however, are a little more involved.

### Twilight's Blade Rares in the Midnight Pre-Patch Event

Rares during the Twilight Ascension event spawn in a rotation in the Twilight Highlands. **Every 10 minutes**, the Twlight's Blade will start an event in the zone, with the zone-wide announcement The Twilight's Blade have begun summoning more forces. Defeat their ritual leaders! When the event starts, the Rare spawns in an immunity shield. Players can break the shield by participating in the three stages of the event:
- **Stop the Ritual**: Kill Twilight's Blade forces and disrupt their camp.
- **Slay the Ritualists**: Kill the three ritualists shielding the Rare mob.
- **Twilight's Champion:** The Twilight's Blade Rare is now vulnerable. Kill them!
