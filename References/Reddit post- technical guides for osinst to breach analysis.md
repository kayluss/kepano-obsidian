Here is a collection of technical guides covering everything from OSINT infrastructure mapping to breach analysis.

We’ve spent the last few weeks documenting exact workflows for digital identity investigation. These aren’t SEO fluff pieces—they are technical playbooks on how to move from a single data point (like a handle or email) to a confirmed attribution.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

[Domain OSINT: From WHOIS to Hidden Infrastructure](https://usersearch.com/resources/intel-hub/blog/domain-osint-whois-infrastructure/)

Most investigators stop at a current WHOIS lookup. This guide shows you how to dig into historical registrar data and DNS records to map an entire hidden corporate network. We cover pivoting on distinct registrant emails to find every other site a target owns.

2) [Beyond the Inbox: A Master Guide to Email OSINT & Breach Analysis](https://usersearch.com/resources/intel-hub/blog/email-osint-breach-analysis-guide/)

Breach data isn't just about finding passwords; it's a map of a target's timeline. We explain how to use public leak data to verify account creation dates and platform usage. Learn why a "pwned" email is often your best starting point for building a profile.

3) [Advanced Username OSINT: How to Profile Targets by Handle Alone](https://usersearch.com/resources/intel-hub/blog/advanced-username-osint-guide/)

Stop guessing common variations of a username and start profiling the human behind the keyboard. This guide breaks down how to analyze username syntax to predict accounts on other platforms. We also cover how to separate a target's main handle from their "throwaway" aliases.

4) [The Art of Reverse Email OSINT: Tracing Digital Identity from Inbox to Profile](https://usersearch.com/resources/intel-hub/blog/reverse-email-osint-investigation-guide)

An email address is the strongest unique identifier in digital investigations. We walk through the methodology of connecting an inbox to dating profiles, social networks, and professional registries. Use this to turn a blind email address into a list of active locations and interests.

5) [Reverse Email OSINT: The Complete Guide to Tracing Digital Identity (2025)](https://usersearch.com/resources/intel-hub/blog/reverse-email-osint-guide)

A comprehensive reference documentation for email investigations in the current privacy landscape. We compare the effectiveness of different reverse-lookup techniques against modern privacy guards. Essential reading for anyone trying to understand what data is actually visible in 2025.

6) [Global Court Record OSINT: Tracking Legal Footprints Across Borders](https://usersearch.com/resources/intel-hub/blog/global-court-record-osint-guide)

Criminal and civil records are often siloed by country, making international due diligence a nightmare. This guide aggregates the best official sources for checking legal history in the UK, US, and Europe. We explain how to correlate a digital identity with physical court filings.

7) [Beyond the Handle: The Complete Guide to Username OSINT & Identity Pivoting](https://usersearch.com/resources/intel-hub/blog/username-osint-investigation-guide)

The definitive manual on pivoting from a username to a real-world identity. We discuss the "Username Reuse Matrix" and how habitual reuse of handles exposes targets across low-security forums. Learn how to automate the check of thousands of sites to find the one mistake they made.

8) [Reverse Phone OSINT: Carrier, Risk, Identity](https://usersearch.com/resources/intel-hub/blog/reverse-phone-osint-carrier-risk-identity)

Phone numbers offer different signals than emails—specifically line type (VoIP vs. Mobile) and carrier data. This guide explains how to identify burner phones and interpret carrier metadata to assess risk. Perfect for fraud analysts trying to distinguish a real user from a bot farm.

9) [Crypto Scam Wallets: Linking Addresses to Websites and Infrastructure](https://usersearch.com/resources/intel-hub/blog/crypto-scam-wallets-linking-addresses-infrastructure)

A wallet address never exists in a vacuum; it’s always tied to technical infrastructure. We show you how to hunt for the websites, domains, and IP addresses hosting the scam kits behind the wallet. Move beyond the blockchain to find the server administrators running the operation.

10) [Image Geolocation & Face Matches: Building Cases from a Single Photo](https://usersearch.com/resources/intel-hub/blog/image-geolocation-face-matches-case)

A single photo can leak location, device type, and social connections if you look closely. We combine reverse image searching with facial recognition to find where else a specific face has appeared online. Learn the workflow for geolocating a target based on background landmarks and visual artifacts.

11) [Telegram Channel OSINT: Members, Messages, and Media at Scale](https://usersearch.com/resources/intel-hub/blog/telegram-channel-osint-members-messages-media)

Telegram is a black box if you rely on manual scrolling, but a goldmine if you use structured search. We explain how to enumerate member lists and search billions of historical messages for keywords. This is how you map a threat actor's activity across hundreds of channels instantly.

12) [Mapping a Username’s 3,000-Site Footprint Without Missing Signals](https://usersearch.com/resources/intel-hub/blog/mapping-username-footprint-3000-sites)

Manual checks on the "top 10" social sites miss 90% of a target's footprint. We demonstrate the value of checking niche forums, gaming sites, and coding repositories at scale. Discover how a forgotten account on a minor platform can be the key to cracking a case.

13) [Reverse Email OSINT: From Breach Clues to Identity Attribution](https://usersearch.com/resources/intel-hub/blog/reverse-email-osint-breach-identity-attribution)

Connecting a leak snippet to a verified person requires a careful chain of evidence. We show you how to pivot from a password dump entry to a live social profile without crossing legal lines. This is the practical workflow for attributing an exposed email to a specific individual.

Happy hunting.
