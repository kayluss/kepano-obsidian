Welcome back, Palians, to the second edition of the Palia Path Roadmap! This is your seasonal snapshot of what’s coming next, what’s quietly brewing behind the scenes, and what exciting adventures lie a little further down the road.

This time around, we’ve got another update from our Director of Production, Maxwell Zierath, with a healthy helping of fresh features, barnyard beginnings, and a peak of what’s just over the horizon.

The leaves are turning, the barn doors are open, and there’s plenty to look forward to. Let’s take a stroll down The Path together!

The Palia Path Roadmap video covers a lot of ground, so we’ve raked it all up for you here:

### Fall Fantasy: Of Barns and Briars (Patch 0.195)

The next patch 0.195, the Fall Fantasy: Of Barns and Briars update, introduces the Ranching skill (Animal Husbandry), new Home Lines, offers crisp new quests, and more. Take a peak of what’s fall-ing into place:

- Ranching Skill (Animal Husbandry)
- Home Lines: The Alchemist’s Cottage
- The Gardener Friendship Quests
- County Fair Bulletin Board Quests
- Introducing new daily quests, Tailor Tickets, and Hair and Makeup colors
- New Farmhouse Decor.
- …and more!

### On the Horizon

Check out what’s coming after Fall Fantasy: Of Barns and Briars. Some updates are just about ready for harvest, while others are still taking root, but all are actively in development!

- Enhancing Player Expression
- Palian Profiles
- Seasonal Celebrations:
	- Spiritfest
	- Winterlights
	- Luna New Year 2026

### Looking Ahead

As summer winds down and the golden season of autumn rolls in, we’re so far from cooling off. The team is hard at work on new features and systems that will roll out over the next several updates, each one shaped by the community's feedback!

We also want to assure you that we’re continuing to develop and experiment with features we mentioned in our last Palia Path, including “Build Together” shared housing, additional accessibility improvements, and, of course, the early stages of our next Adventure Zone.

The team really appreciates seeing how you engage with the gameplay and design, and your feedback plays a key role in helping us improve the Palia Player experience over time.

### Final Thoughts

Whether you’re snuggling up with your Ormuu, or busting out the decor for Spiritfest, we’re excited to continue bringing the world of Palia to life.

We hope this second edition of Palia Path paints a clearer picture of what’s coming, and the seasonal surprises we’re preparing for the brisk months ahead.

There’s plenty of discovery waiting just over the horizon. Cozy season may be arriving, but things in Palia are just starting to heat up.
