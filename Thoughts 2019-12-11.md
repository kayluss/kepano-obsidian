   - Checked my email and the iPad should be here tomorrow. Watching Atlas Shrugged part 2.
- Not sure how or what to think about Atlas shrugged. It’s relevant somehow. I’m not done watching it yet. Still pondering going paperless or not. The movie is an extreme take on individuality vs society. Pubg mobile still wont update for my device. My head seems to be moving in a better direction.
