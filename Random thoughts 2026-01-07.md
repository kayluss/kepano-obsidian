I want to go out with my camera today as it’s foggy but I am tired. Period week before and during is always exhausting. 

[[Prody]] is actually playing with the different tips on her cage. The mornings are much better than they were a few months ago. She is all around the outside of cage. Doesn’t spend a whole on top, only to retrieve treats. I’m currently watching her trying to figure out how to get the sunflower seeds out of the mason jar on my desk.
