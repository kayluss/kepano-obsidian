Obituary
	
	BOCA RATON, Fla. — The family of Vivian (McCoy) Owens, 83, formerly of Charlotte, North Carolina, mournfully announce Vivian’s passing Sunday, Dec. 29, 2024, in Boca Raton, Florida.
	
	Vivian was born in Mount Carmel, June 29, 1941.
	
	She was a National Honor Society student at Mount Carmel High School and led the band as drum majorette. She was crowned “Queen of Hearts” at her high school ball.
	
	Vivian was both athletic and musically gifted. She played trombone, piano, basketball, volleyball and enjoyed ice skating in her youth.
	
	After graduating high school, Vivian attended Geisinger School of Nursing, in Danville. It was here that Vivian met her former husband and father of her children, Bruce Bailey, who attended nearby Bucknell University. Vivian and Bruce raised two daughters, Bonnie and Elaine, and lived in various places in Connecticut and New York before moving to Charlotte, North Carolina, in the 1970s.
	Vivian began her career with the Charlotte Mecklenburg School system in the 1970s, working in the school psychology department until her retirement in 2001. Vivian and Bruce divorced in 1977, and then Vivian married Earl S. Owens in 1980. Vivian and Earl made a wonderful life together until Earl’s sudden death in 2001.
	
	Vivian had many passions, including a love for animals, bird watching, gardening, reading and walking the greenways and mountain trails. She treasured her girls’ trips with her daughters to various destinations and their “weekends in Waynesville.” She had a magnetic personality and would make friends everywhere she went.
	
	Vivian was tragically diagnosed with Alzheimer’s in 2021, and eventually moved into Artis Senior Living Memory Care, in Boca Raton, where she lived for one and a half years before passing after a brief respiratory illness.
	
	Vivian leaves behind a devoted family who mourns her loss, including her daughters, Bonnie Theise (Brian) and Elaine Bailey (Marc Kool); siblings, Linda Procopio (Charlie), Judy Hefley (Colin) and Harold McCoy (Barbara). Vivian was known as “Mama-V” by her grandchildren, Trent Kool (Sierra), Michael Theise (Christina) and Jacqueline Theise; and four great-grandchildren. Vivian also leaves behind multiple nieces; a nephew; and several cousins. Vivian will also be dearly missed by her many friends, including her long-time friend, Allen Osborne.
	
	She was preceded in death by her late husband, Earl S. Owens, of Charlotte, North Carolina; her parents, Harold Walter McCoy and Pauline (Koons) McCoy; and her sister, Marilyn Simmons.
	
	OWENS — Vivian (McCoy) Owens, 83, of Boca Raton, Florida, and formerly of Charlotte, North Carolina. A celebration of life for the family is planned in Boca Raton, Florida. In lieu of flowers, Vivian requested donations to Planned Parenthood, The Humane Society and American Heart Association. Donations to the Alzheimer’s Association would also be honored.
