[[One Damn Thing After Another]]
    -   pg 87 __ “Many states has relapsed to the kind of revolving door justic that predominated during the 1960’s, 1970’s. This was a consequence of state budget pressures and the reemergence of liberal polices that excused criminality and undervalued individual responsibilities.”__
        - Instead of focusing on why crime was happening the analysis too Bill Bar was focused on who and how separate those person from society.  
        - The choice of saying “ excused criminality and undervalued individual responsible” is clear propaganda and avoidance of fixing root causes of crime in society
