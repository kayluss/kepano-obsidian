Did anyone else see the bright orange meteorite tonight??

I saw it to the West of Appleton heading North around 12:30am.  It was bright orange with a longer tail that looked like sparks and moved pretty fast across the sky.  It appeared to break into pieces before disappearing. 

I was driving and didn't get video of it.  I'm guessing it was a satellite burning up as it re-entered the atmosphere.  What a cool sight to see on my way home from
