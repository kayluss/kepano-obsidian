Swan Queen inspired

One look, and  I know
		- the darkness inside of me, I took from you
		- you can no longer hide
		- you're not alone
		- I understand the pain you have, the path that you've walked
		- Time stood still for all those years, you were waiting for me
		- now that I'm here, I'm not letting you go
		- You can't disappear
		- I see you
