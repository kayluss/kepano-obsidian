Notes: 
    - Jan considers runes to be a collection of sacred symbols more so than an Alphabet. He also claims that some of them have been in Magickal use for over 30,000 years. this claim is why he considers r one magick as a conglomeration of religious signs from the Neanderthal periods us. Germanic or Norse tradition.
    - The book is in Three sections named after the Norns
        - Urda - Past Roots
        - Werdandi- Present Siem
        - Skulda- future Branches
            - flows of development
    - Germania-Tacitus-Look for a copy
    - [[Out of Africa I theory]]-the people running the Date, did not run enough calculations.
    - [[Out of Africa I theory]]-brought about the idea that Homo Sapiens are natural killers. That leads to the thought process of war is natural and inevitable.
    - Red ochre was used during the neanderthal times and continued with out closest ancestor. In addition they also use ornaments, possibly proto runes.
    - Pg 45 the discussion of [[cave art]] points out That The Art is fully developed and in hard to access areas, secret areas. this makes the suggestion of Caves as churches a bit of a stretch. and interpreting them from a magickal perspective seems more logical.
    - Jan talks about the beginning of [[Altamira cave]] and cave art. At the beginning of the studies, it was thought these were sympathetic magick. with further discoveries was this theory was discarded. This is important we tend to forget that there can always be more data that changes our perspective. We as pagans, witches, and magicians should do well to guard against being inflexible in thought or practice.
    - [[Myth of the Great Goddess]]
        - a monotheistic idea  from the 19th century, of which there is no data to support this idea. It was an easy jump for the scholars of a  predominantly Christian age to make. The Isis of Romano-Greek mystery cult is an exception to early pagan goddesses. 
        - Mother Nature is an invention of the industrial age,()[[Ronald Hutton]]) to institute gender roles. Gods had technology and progress, where as Goddesses had chastity, motherly, and fertility roles. this thought process is most likely why scholars first studying the "[[Venus Goddess]] Statues" assumed fertility.
        - The triple Goddess symbol is the most conservative representation boiling the Goddess down to human biology This was introduced by [[Robert Graves]]. As this was happening in the  Modern Pagan Movement, the belief of the Great goddess/ matriarchal theory was fading with scholars due to more data that did not support the theory. 
        - [[Definition]]: loess- extremely fertile soil near rivers
        - Indo-Europeans are a hypothetical people with language traces but no archeological evidence as of the publication of this book. If this is a theory how does snurriâs sagas play to this theory? A few paragraphs later Aryans are mention as to possibly being cousins to Germanic people due to the similarities of the Veddas and Eddas.
        - immanuel Veilikovsky- Was blacklisted because he suggested the earth had several geological catastrophes through out the ages. 
        - Celts and Germani people still have an unknown origin. Caesar and Tacitus differ on their description of the German people. dear tended toward primitive barbarians while Tacitus Leland toward noble savages. Caesar never distinguished between tribes, just used a geographical division to label the tribes.
        - The[[ Prose Eddas]] is a handbook for skalds with the most common part of the myths we know now. There was no fundamental Norse pagan religion practiced in prehistory or the age before snorting.
