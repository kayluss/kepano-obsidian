        - to enjoy the quiet morning
- [[Daily Affirmation]]
        - I am ok as I am
- [[What am I thinking of?]]
        - I am very fatigued, I notice sone spotting last night. I called out of work today and now I am glad. I can feel my body preparing to menstruate.
        - I should get a reading to seek clarity on what would suit me better in terms of fulfillment.
