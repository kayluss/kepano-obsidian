[[Pakiras]] [[**The Adventures of Pakiras**]]
	Tags:  Story [[WoW]]
	 Ever since Darion Mograine rebelled against the Lich King, the Death Knights have been free of the Lich King's voice. Pakiras like many of the Ebon Knights are awash in memories of their previous life, to the point of disorientation.  
	  "Arthas!" Tirion Fordring yells. That is the last thing Pakiras remembers from the end of the battle for Light's Hope. There are vagues bits of fighting at Ebon Hold, floating in his head, but nothing concrete.  
	  Opening his eyes, Pakiras looks around at his surroundings. Recognizing the spartan room as his quarters in the Ebon Hold, He notices his current minion over in the far corner next to his gear. Hearing voices outside his door, pakiras decides to investigate the status of Ebon Hold.   
	   "Graverobber! Bring me my Gear." Commands Pakiras. Dutifully the Geist brings Pakiras his gear and helps him with some of the armor. Exiting the room Pakiras with his geist head for the commons area of this floor. 
	  During the walk to the common area, Pakiras noticed the lack of dark energy normally found in Ebon Hold. The energy is more of a grey energy, not as sadistic but not quite the color of Paladins.

     Background facts 
     1. Died an Orc Shaman, Was resurected as a DK. 
     2. Fought at the battle for Light's Hope Chapel 
     3. Easily feels the energy of things, an attribute held over from years of shaman rituals and beliefs. Since becoming a Death Knight his shamanic abilities transformed into unholy abilities. 
     4. More past life memories creep into thought more and more since breaking from the lich king. 
     5. Has no family. He used to be a bodyguard for his family's traveling caravan. During one of the trips through Northrend, they were attacked. Pakiras was killed and his family captured. They were carrying intelligence on the scourge. He was raised as a Death Knight and in the process was forced to kill his family. They were traders and have taught him how to intergrate into different cultures and discover information. His family also dealt in information which taught skills in espionage. These skills are not overtly advertised, His strengh and combat prowess. Most people assumed he was all brute and little brains before being transformed into a death knight. 
     6. After the battle @ light's hope chapel, Pakiras spent months with the Ebon Blade training to understand how to deal with the transformation and need to inflict pain. Pakiras finaaly settled on specializing in the unholy arts to be able to summon a ghoul. Which he uses to sate the need to inflict pain, as ghouls naturally do not feel pain. As time goes on he summons ghouls less for the need and more for the company. Being an Undead he spends alot of time alone. 
     7. Cooking has become one of his new hobbies, more as a skill that eases relations with the living. It also lets him escape into thinking he is still alive, although temporary state. 
     8. During his time living in Archerus he learned how to mix his orc shaman heritage with the runic arts instilled by the Scourge. The transformation altered how Pakiras interacts with nature and the elemental forces. Pakiras felt Deathwing emerging and twisting energies of Azeroth. He decided then to help fight against deathwing, in the hopes he could restore honor to his name.
