        - # So what's the real story about this Longevinex® miracle pill?
        - ![Box](http://www.imarketingcenter.com/graphics/LongeBox1.jpg)
        - ## Well we're going to find out if it's
        - the truth or a lot of "PR" hype!
        - After many emails back and forth with Bill Sardi, (developer/partner of this Longevinex®
        - product), I've decided to give it a 90 day trial and see just what it could do for my diabetes.
        - (I'll update this page as I have the results.)
        - Now if you think this is a cheap experiment.... It's not!
        - All the vitamins and suppliments for a 90 day supply ran $305.00 and his Longevinex®
        - ran about $115.00
        - Sardi made a ton of recommendations, and this is where the red flags/concerns come into play.
        - First he tells me to stop eating all breads/pasta/fruit sugars.... Well that just killed 90% of my diet!
        - Then he tells me to stop taking almost every one of my prescriptions!
        - ▶  Amaryl
        - ▶  Liptor
        - ▶  Cozaar
        - ▶  and about 4 others rx's
        - ▶  my daily aspirin
        - Well within three day my BSL's (Blood Sugar Levels) went thru the roof!!! From being below 130 I was now hitting the mid to high 300's!!!! Guess what, I'm back on all my prescriptions.
        - So, I fired off another email asking him for a timeline as to how long it will take to see an improvement? And what did I get!?
        - "Quote:**Well, I can't play doctor from afar.**Unquote"
        - **SAY WHAT??? "HE"** was the one telling me to stop taking all my rx meds!
        - **"RED FLAG"**
        - He never did say anything as to how long it would take.
        - Here's all the pills he's got me taking, **34 pills**
        - ![All the pills](http://www.imarketingcenter.com/graphics/pills.jpg)
        - Now I heard him on the Coast-2-Coast Radio show and the more I thought about the storyline he was telling.... I had to go back and listen to it again.
        - YUP! To me it's a made up PR-BS story.
        - What he was saying is: He had an 80 year old man that was taking Longevinex® "For NO particular Reason" He was just taking it to encourage his wife to take it.
        - Yeah.... Right; The man bought twice as many pills/taking another pill "For No Reason"?......Does this make sense?
        - But now the plot thickens -- Now the man is a diabetic/has heart problem/eye problems. He goes in for his A1C lab test and the doctor comes in and tells him that he is no longer a diabetic... he's CURED!!
        - Just looking at the diabetes part. Here's my problem with this:
        - ANY diabetic that is watching his BSL's (sugar Levels), has to check it at least once a day and most check it 3 times a day, so they know how much insulin to take.
        - Why didn't he see that his BSL readings were all normal for weeks/months!? No diabetic would take a shot if his readings are normal; to do that they would have crashed and ended up in the hospital.
        - Now getting back to me and my test run; At the time of this writing I'm in week #5 and the only change I see is my BSL's are running about 20 points higher.
        - ## Stay tuned for the next installment, (month2).
        - Well it’s been a LONG 60 days and
        - I’m really getting sick and tried
        - of take all these pills.
        - What’s been happening!?!?! Nothing good that’s for sure.
        - I’ve had to order another 45 BUCKS in more vitamins.
        - I have NOT seen ANY change or improvements; in fact just the
        - opposite, my BSL readings have gone “UP” not down… I’m now
        - running 160 to 175 instead of at/or below the 125/135 levels.
        - DAM! Will I be glad when this test is over and I can get back to
        - eating real food. I feel like I’m living on just the vitamins and
        - supplements instead of food.
        - I sure don’t hold out much hope in seeing any improvements in
        - the next 30 days, but I’ve paid for all this stuff so I’m going to
        - use them up even if it goes on past the 90 day mark.
        - I sure won’t miss coughing/ gagging/ choking on some of those
        - monster pills. Some are almost an inch long and look like a
        - football shape.
        - I’ll be back at the end of April with the final results.
        - Grandpa Bill
        - OH! I just got a phone call threating me with a cease and
        - desist order for telling my story.... A TOTAL violation of
        - my rights of "FREEDOM OF SPEECH"!
        - I am telling everyone about **"MY" Experiences ONLY **and
        - what this product and all the recommended vitamins and
        - supplements has done for me.
        - ## Well I went way over the 90 days, in fact I went **over 120 days** of that miracle pill.
        - ![Box](http://www.imarketingcenter.com/graphics/LongeBox1.jpg)
        - So What was the final outcome of this test?!?!? Nothing good that's for sure.
        - ### For one big factor is the cost!
        - This test has set me back about **$700.00** over my prescriptions.
        - My BSL (Blood-Sugar-Levels) hit **a high of 400** with a final averaging around
        - 250/280 and I'm still working on getting it back down into the 125/135 range.
        - Needless to say my doctor was not happy about this experiment and he just
        - might be checking out the man giving medical advice without a licence.(I
        - personally don't know for sure one way or another.) ie: Telling me to stop
        - taking my diabetic prescriptions as well as other prescriptions. (And I still
        - have all the emails to prove it!)
        - I just took another reading and I'm at 189 @ 2:45 AM. Looks like I need another shot.**{:tag :h2}(Thank You Longevinex -- "NOT"!)**
