## 15 professionals skills

Here are 15 types of soft skills that can help further your professional career:

The world is changing and the job market is changing with it. Thanks to breakthrough technology like cloud computing and AI, a remote workforce brought on by the pandemic, and other new emerging trends, the job market as we know it is about to look a whole lot different. And that can feel pretty scary. How will you find stability in the face of such a major shift? Well, the truth is it all comes down to skills. As long as your skills and abilities remain relevant, you'll always be valuable to employers. Hey, everybody. I'm Sinéad. And today, I'm going to be sharing the top four best skills to have in the changing job market. And we're calling these the best skills because they're uniquely acquired and therefore cannot be replaced by technology. And be sure to stick around until the very last one because in the long run, it really is the most critical. Now, it's easy to understand why some people feel like technology is taking over. However, most innovation is actually creating jobs rather than eliminating them. Sure, phone operation is a job of the past but smartphone technicians, social media managers, and app developers are thriving. Based on advancements in technology and rising trends like globalization, urbanization, and automation, we probably could predict at least a few jobs that will be most in-demand in the future. But the exact future is still, of course, unpredictable. Let's be real, nobody can be 100% sure how advancing technology will one day impact specific jobs. So instead of looking for a future-proof roles, it's smarter to future-proof yourself and your knowledge. By honing irreplaceable skills, you can protect your potential earning power, regardless of the shifting market. So are you ready to future-proof your skills? Let's get started. Skill one, creativity and critical thinking. Look at the world around us. We are officially in the age of the self-driving car. So even if we can't say exactly how and to what extent certain jobs will be impacted, looking at the trends in automation still allows us to make informed guesses about the future of the job market. And more importantly, for job seekers, which skills may become less valuable in the future, such as hard skills related to repeated predictable tasks. Exhibit A, most of us are familiar with the self-checkout systems at the grocery store. Now, let's look at clerical work. Bookkeeping, data entry, and proofreading are also skills that technology does incredibly well, and often more accurately than humans. So what can't technology do or at least exceed in? Yes, I know we've all seen a lot of movies but in reality, machines are still machines that are programmed to respond and act in a certain way, which means very little creativity, and critical thinking. Machines may be able to generate data about plants and flowers, but it can't put together a uniquely gorgeous floral arrangement. Now, you may show your creativity through art or music, or your creativity may shine when you're strategizing about how to improve the product or process. Honing your creativity and perfecting those critical thinking skills is a matter of practice and intention. Start by establishing your goals. They could be personal or maybe you have goals for your company. Now, put in some time. Even a few minutes a day to write out your goals, talk through them with others, or just iron out the creative details of your goals in your own head. But be consistent and formalize what you are doing. Creativity often flourishes with deliberate nurturing. So no, don't worry if you don't immediately have that aha moment. Just keep carving out space for ideas to manifest. Creativity will make itself known and you'll be sharpening up your critical thinking skills too. Now, before I move on to our next best skill, if you've watched this far, be sure to give this video like, subscribe to our channel, and hit that notification bell, and then head down to the comments and let us know what skill do you think will be most valuable in the future. Now moving on to skill number two, emotional intelligence. We often overlook the value of emotional intelligence also called EQ in the workplace. But seriously, businesses need employees with strong emotional intelligence. EQ is a combination of many abilities like self-awareness, reaction regulation, active listening, empathy, and communication. All of which support positive relationships. Of course, there are some jobs that obviously require more emotional skills like being a caregiver, a therapist, or a social worker. But roles in sales, customer service, project management, and so many more also require emotional intelligence to support strong communication and to manage the interests of multiple parties. Regardless of industries, all managers benefit from emotionally intelligent employees since it's a foundational skill for leadership. Plus, like creativity, EQ is something that requires a human touch so it will continue to hold in value in an increasingly automated marketplace. Now, for more information about EQ in the workplace as well as how you can improve yours, check out this video right here. While creativity and emotional intelligence are skills that technology can't easily replicate, let's move on to two more skills that will help you keep up with technological innovation. Skill number three, analyzing data. These days, companies have to manage more data than ever before. Being skilled at analyzing data and turning it into meaningful information is incredibly valuable to employers because companies can use that knowledge to grow. Sure, computers are getting better and better at collecting data but the strategic nuanced lens of the human mind is essential when it comes to analyzing data, synthesizing reports, and making business recommendations. A data analyst is a specific job that you can pursue but the skill set can improve your value and performance in so many jobs. Yes, including non-technical jobs. For example, marketers need data analysts to evaluate the success of various campaigns while fields like HR rely on data interpretation when it comes to hiring, performance management, and compensation. So basically, it's smart to sharpen this skill, and the best way to do that is to actually engage with data. If you're feeling intimidated by the learning curve, search for associated online courses. So many are totally free. And for even more online courses or certificates that could help boost your career, you can check out this video right here. All right, as promised, our last recommendation is one of the most important skills required for future success. Skill four, adaptability. People who consistently push themselves to serve as their own teacher have the skill of adaptability. Think about doctors, nurses, or really any role in the medical field. They are constantly researching, learning about new diseases and new treatments for the sake of their patients' health and well-being. But this isn't just a trait of successful doctors. Being adaptable in any role can make you essential. Some companies may support their employees' continued learning by providing access to courses or lectures, which is great. But always remember that no one-- not your boss, your CEO, or your HR manager-- will look out for your career like you will. Don't ever expect anyone and pull you aside and explain what knowledge you may lack or how you can propel yourself professionally. The best thing you can do to really future-proof yourself is to invest in continuing education. Now, it may feel like a huge undertaking but you can actually get started just by evaluating and determining your current skills and knowledge. And then ask yourself, what are my strengths? And in what areas do I feel like I can grow? And pro tip here, write it down, be intentional. Then make a plan to self-manage your goals. Continue to ask yourself how you can level up your strengths and fill in those learning gaps as you set a plan. And as you set deadlines. Oh yeah, and don't let deadlines stress you out. They allow you to fully see your progress and they hold you accountable. Now, if you're not sure which of your skills could use some growth, consider what's changing in the industry and ask yourself, what new technologies are being developed? What new trends are emerging? Who stands out as a top performer in my workplace? And what tools are they using? Stay ahead of the curve by preparing yourself not only to crush your current job, but for where your job and industry are headed. Reading the latest news, being an early adopter of new tools, or attending conferences, and yes, you can now virtually attend so many conferences these days, or always, you can become more adaptable. Remember, this is all about future proofing yourself so embrace the change and remain hungry to learn. All right, let's quickly review these skills that you can focus on to future-proof your career. Creativity and critical thinking-- whether artistic or strategic in focus, being a creative and critical thinker is an irreplaceable strength. Emotional intelligence-- even if your job doesn't seem to directly relate to emotions, EQ can support your performance and leadership potential. When faced with an increasingly automated future, people who know how to interact well with others become more valuable. Data analysis-- with so much information streaming in, companies need people who know how to interpret data and make appropriate recommendations with a more nuanced lens than software can offer. Adaptability-- the ability to self-direct your professional learning can make all the difference in such an innovative marketplace. Embrace change and get excited to adapt to new information and technologies. All right. If you are feeling more ready than ever to future-proof yourself, be sure to this video.
