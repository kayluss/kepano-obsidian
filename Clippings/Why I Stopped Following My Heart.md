### And started following my checklist

*Welcome to part 1 in a three part series on slut dating strategy. (That is dating strategy endorsed by us sluts. You probably don’t have to be a slut to find it helpful!)*

I currently have three boyfriends and I’m embarrassingly happy about them. If you follow me on Twitter, you’ve almost certainly been subjected to my insufferable sharing all about my ongoing [obsession](https://x.com/Pandora_Delaney/status/2010260705140670834?s=20) with them. They are each catches in their own right, and even more miraculously, they all get along with each other beautifully, with minimal friction. Even if you aren’t looking to mesh three boyfriends into a kitchen table poly set up, I still think that the overthinking I applied to my dating process may be useful, or at least entertaining.

Here’s the unfashionable truth about how I found fulfilling relationships: I stopped pretending dating was some mystical process where you “follow your heart” and “trust the universe.” Instead, I got strategic and faced uncomfortable truths. I thought about dating like both a **market** and like a **compatibility matching problem**. I got real about the **signaling** and **screening** dynamics in dating. And it worked. No astrology required.

## The Problem With “Following Your Heart”

For years, I dated without much strategy, because most available advice was either extractive manipulation tactics designed around hating the opposite sex (*e.g.,* Female Dating Strategy, pick up artistry) or unhelpful cliches (*e.g.,* “you’ll find it when you least expect it, or “when you know you know”). Like most of my friends: I swiped for the hottest guys who could hold a conversation, chased the “spark”, and deluded myself I could make anything work despite obvious red flags. My Catholic upbringing had taught me suffering was akin to love, so surely I was doing something right if I was constantly suffering, right? Right!?

Shockingly, this didn’t work out great for me! I kept ending up with men who were wrong for me in predictable, avoidable ways. After a few frustrating rounds of failure, I realized the common denominator was...me. My selection process was broken.

It’s me, hi, I’m the problem, it’s me.

Trial and error is fine as a starting point in your early 20s, but only if you’re actually learning from the experiments. Unfortunately, I was a chemistry junkie, willing to overlook glaring issues if the spark felt alive enough. It took pretty extreme disillusionment to realize I couldn’t simply “follow my heart.” My heart was a traitor to my better judgement. It desperately wanted kinky 6’7” postdocs with debilitating levels of avoidance. My brain wanted someone who would actually respond to my texts and who would be a good father to potential future kids. Upon hitting my mid 20s, I decided I needed to get *ruthlessly* systematic.

## Three Frameworks for Overthinking Dating

I started thinking about dating through a few lenses to try to get a handle on the process and how to approach it. The first is one that most people find uncomfortable to admit out loud:

### The Marketplace Framework

If you buy into the evolutionary psychology idea that we each have a particular “mate value” in the sexual marketplace, then it’s worth being pretty careful about where we are spending our points. If I go broke by splashing out on a gorgeous face, 99.9th percentile height, and abs… well I might regret that when there’s nothing left to spend on personality or intelligence or emotional availability.

I don’t think this is a perfect model of relationships. It oversimplifies the complex dynamics of attraction and connection, and reduces people to tradeable commodities in ways that can feel a bit dehumanizing. But pretending these dynamics don’t exist doesn’t make them go away. We all know that assortative mating is happening when we observe who tends to couple up. People are making tradeoffs in the dating market, including “settling” for someone of a similar mate value, whether they admit it or not. Understanding this reality helped me make better strategic decisions (in part 2 of this series, I’ll dig more into the specifics).

I think part of the reason people are loath to admit to this dynamic is that unless you fall at the very highest end of the “mate value” spectrum, you are basically admitting that you “settled for” your partner, and would have dated someone “better” if you could. This is not a great thing to imply! Normal people tend to err towards being a bit delusional about saying their partner is “the handsomest guy in the world” or whatever. Meanwhile, rationalists tend to have a bit more comfort with statements like “my partner is very attractive to me and I picked him for the totality of his traits” – without waxing hyperbolic.

Overall, I think the marketplace framing should be used sparingly. Yes it contains insights, but overdosing can lead to black and white (or incel/redpill) thinking. Generally, I prefer the compatibility framework, while still recognizing that a portion of compatibility relates to your relative mate values.

### The Compatibility Framework

The second lens is compatibility matching, and is generally less controversial. What do I actually need in a partner? What can I outsource to other relationships or friendships? What looks good on paper but doesn’t actually matter for my daily happiness?

This is less about marketplace dynamics and more about honest self-knowledge. It’s the difference between “I want someone tall because society values height” vs “I want someone tall because I notice a marked difference in my body’s response to their presence… but actually there might be other ways someone can achieve that response.”

The compatibility framework functions best when you don’t just look at your stated preferences, but also pay attention to your revealed preferences. It means asking yourself the hard questions about why you end up attracted to avoidants despite claiming to want someone securely attached. If you can get real about what is attractive there, you may be able to distill it down to healthier levels. For me, dating secure men who are kind of workaholics grants me a lot of the freedom and attraction to independence that also drew me to avoidants.

Compatibility is also about what functions a relationship is expected to fulfill. In modern dating, part of the struggle is in looking for a best friend, lover, travel buddy, roommate, and future co-parent all in one package. That’s a lot of criteria! Being clear about what is the most important, what can’t be outsourced vs what can, and where you can balance a partner’s weaknesses, are all important in considering compatibility.

Within polyamory, people may be more open to designer relationships (where you can customize the relationship according to overlapping desires instead of relying on defaults), which don’t place as many expectations on a single partner. But then you have to have additional criteria around them actually being good at poly, so that things run smoothly.

Having some self knowledge, and knowledge of how you show up in previous relationships, is a good starting point for compatibility assessments. If you aren’t clear on the relationship structure you want, your stance on kids, etc, this piece is more challenging.

I generally endorse the compatibility framework and it’s the one I reach for most often when thinking about dating decisions. I think compatibility is super important and that the primary pitfall is unrealistic expectations (wanting a Build-a-Bear partner who is compatible in every single dimension). Therefore, in part 2 of this series where I dive into strategies, one thing I’ll talk about is how to avoid this.

### The Signaling/Screening Framework

What the compatibility framework overlooks is that there’s a lot of distance between “stranger I met on Hinge for a coffee date” and “someone I feel capable of evaluating for life partnership.” That’s why the third lens involves thinking about dating as an information problem. You don’t know who someone really is. They don’t know who you really are. The process of dating is about figuring out how to reveal and evaluate this information efficiently.

Signaling is what you broadcast about yourself. This is not just your dating profile, but everything you do that communicates who you are and what you want. The goal isn’t to appeal to the maximum number of people. It’s to appeal intensely to the right people while efficiently filtering out the wrong ones.

Screening is how you evaluate potential partners, from the questions you ask, the situations you create, the boundaries you set, and the patterns you look for.

Dating involves sending out signals and screening incoming signals. Some people are not very aware of how their signals are landing and lots of people signal terribly. Generic profiles (”I like sushi!”), superficial conversations, hiding anything “too much” until later. This is backwards and a massive waste of everyone’s time.

Lots of people don’t like the fact that dating involves being your own PR department. Crafting a good dating profile is a lot of work and deserves its own post, so I won’t get into that here.

Some people are actually too good at signaling, but don’t actually live up to their signals. This sort of false positive is why it’s important to continue gathering data over a long enough time. Everyone is aware of catfishing but there are subtler forms of this too. Part of the reason I think it’s strategic to rapidly move from texting to a video call or first date (in an online dating context), is that this allows you to screen out the catfishes, or the people for whom the attraction simply doesn’t translate offline.

Costly signaling is especially powerful, because this helps you communicate something important:

- Mentioning polyamory in your dating profile
- Being specific about your kinks early
- Sharing that you have a “Date Me” doc

These signals are “costly” because they risk turning people off. That’s the point! If someone is turned off by the real you, better to know immediately than three months in.

I used to hide my university on dating apps because I worried it would intimidate men. Now I lean into being a nerd. The men who find intelligence intimidating filter themselves out. And then I don’t have to date insecure men who don’t understand fractions, which is a win in my book.

My “Sex Doc” and “Guide to Dating Me” are both signals and screens. These show a lot of my cards upfront (kinks, communication style, needs, quirks, relationship preferences). They signal that I know myself well and value clarity. They screen out people who find this level of explicitness off-putting.

Getting good at signaling and screening means less time wasted on incompatible matches, faster revelation of red flags, and attracting people who actually like you. You build relationships on genuine compatibility from day one instead of discovering deal-breakers three months in.

I think signaling is often overlooked because people don’t want to have to do PR, want to be loved for themselves, and aren’t always that aware of others’ perceptions. But it’s important to be able to make it through the crucible of dating by getting good at it. Having all the compatibility in the world with someone won’t matter if they filter you out on the apps because you didn’t signal well.

## The Frameworks Work Together

The marketplace lens helps you understand where you stand and what tradeoffs to make. The compatibility lens ensures you’re being strategic about the right thing, that is, actual fit, not just surface-level attractiveness. The signaling/screening lens helps you efficiently find and evaluate matches.

Being your authentic self is the bridge between them. You maximize your value in the market by becoming the best version of who you actually are, not by becoming who you think you “should” be. You find true compatibility by letting people see the real you and filtering for those who genuinely like what they see. And you signal and screen most effectively when you’re honest about what you want and what you offer.

## The Mindset Shift: Abundance vs Scarcity

Here’s the thing that makes all of these frameworks actually work: you need to operate from a place of abundance, not scarcity.

When you’re desperate, you compromise on things that matter. You ignore red flags. You try to force compatibility that isn’t there. You date from fear of being alone rather than genuine excitement about the person.

I ardently wish I could go back in time to my 21-year-old self and shake her and tell her that there are plenty of kinky men and I don’t need to compromise my other criteria for them. Having a scarcity mindset around finding kink-compatible men contributed to years of staying in the wrong relationship. This really underscores the importance of understanding base rates of various traits in the dating pool.

On the other hand, when you’re abundant, you can be selective. You can wait for actual compatibility instead of settling for “good enough.” You can walk away from situations that aren’t serving you.

Becoming more selective and having higher standards improved my dating life. Because I was attracting better matches and not wasting time on dead-ends.

## What My Specific Problem Was

To be clear about my context: I didn’t have trouble getting men to date me or even fall in love with me. My problem was that I wasn’t great at picking ones who were securely attached and good long-term matches.

Your dating challenges might be totally different! If you struggle to get dates at all, your strategy should focus more on expanding your pool and maximizing your own desirability. If you’re getting dates but they never go anywhere, you might need to work on building genuine connection while being your authentic self.

Understanding your specific bottleneck matters. These frameworks are generally helpful to understand, but the specific strategies I distilled from them should be understood in context. My problem was selection, not attraction.

## From Frameworks to Strategies

Understanding these three lenses—marketplace, compatibility, and signaling/screening—changed how I thought about dating. But abstract frameworks alone don’t get you three boyfriends. You need actual strategies that influence how you spend your precious time as a dater.

In part 2, I’ll break down several concrete strategies I used to go from theory to results. Things like:

- How to compromise strategically (on what others care about but you don’t)
- The art of rapid information gathering
- When to walk away from “fine” relationships
- The dating checklist I used to evaluate potential partners
