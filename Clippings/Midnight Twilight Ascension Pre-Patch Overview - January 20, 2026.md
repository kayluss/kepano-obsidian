## New Specialization in Midnight Pre-Patch: Devourer Demon Hunter

Demon Hunters can now access their third specialization with the Midnight pre-patch. [Devourer](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/talent-calc/demon-hunter/devourer/annihilator) is a new DPS specialization that uses a mix of melee and ranged attacks to deal damage with the powers of the Void. The Devourer specialization will be automatically unlocked for all Demon Hunters with the release of the Midnight pre-patch.  
  
Vengeance Demon Hunters will exchange the Fel-Scarred hero talent tree for the new hero talent tree, **Annihilator**, shared with Devourer.

### New Demon Hunter Race: Void Elf

The Midnight pre-patch introduces Void Elf Demon Hunters. Players will need to go through a short questline to unlock this new race/  class combination.
- **Requirements**: Completing the [In Search of Darkness](https://www.wowhead.com/storyline/in-search-of-darkness-5770) storyline from K'aresh, starting with [A Common Cause](https://www.wowhead.com/quest=90972/a-common-cause) and ending with [Hunger of the Void](https://www.wowhead.com/quest=91044/hunger-of-the-void).
- The Void Elf Demon Hunter storyline starts with [The Pursuit Continues](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/quest=92630/the-pursuit-continues) in Dornogal (or Silvermoon after Midnight's launch) and ends with [Trial of Wrath](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/quest=92632/trial-of-wrath).

## User Interface and Addon Updates in Midnight Pre-Patch

The Midnight pre-patch institutes the first wave of Blizzard's philosophy shift toward addons: a greater reliance on in-game tools rather than third-party work.
- Addons no longer have access to most combat information, meaning addons cannot update combat information in real time.
- Instead, combat information and addons rely on editing the look of Blizzard UI elements, with updates and changes:
	- Cooldown Manager, Raid Frames, and Friendly/  Enemy Nameplates have been expanded with extra functionality.
	- An all-new Damage Meter, Boss Timers interface with an ability timeline, and more.

## Stat Squish in Midnight Pre-Patch

The Midnight expansion also brings World of Warcraft's fourth stat squish. Starting with the Midnight pre-patch, numbers across the game will be scaled down algorithmically, including item stats, damage, and health for both players and mobs. You can see a comparison of the before and after from the live game and Midnight below:

## Transmogrification Changes in Midnight Pre-Patch

Transmogrification is undergoing several quality-of-life changes, starting with the Midnight pre-patch.
- **Outfits**: Instead of transmogging an individual gear piece, transmogs now apply to an outfit. Once you select an outfit, all gear you equip will automatically update its appearance to match it. In Midnight, players start with two outfit slots unlocked, but they can purchase up to 18 additional slots with gold.
- **Situations**: Situations is a new transmog system, allowing players to automatically change their transmog based on certain parameters - when you're mounted up, for example, or if you're doing specific types of content, like dungeons, raids, delves, or PvP. Situations can also apply to other settings, such as different specializations, or you could even have different sets for different forms if you're a Dracthyr or Worgen. Situations are an optional system in transmogging, but they open up a wide range of customization options for your character.

## Class Changes in Midnight Pre-Patch

Midnight Class Changes are also being added in the pre-patch, which includes:
- New and revamped talents for all 39 specializations.
- A fourth column containing three new talent options for all Hero specializations. While you cannot spec into all 13 Hero talents during the pre-patch, all points will be available at Level 90 in Midnight.

## Elven Housing Exteriors in Midnight Pre-Patch

With the Midnight Pre-Patch, Elven Housing exteriors are being introduced into Player Housing. Alliance players can decorate their exteriors with Night Elf moonlit structures, while Horde players can decorate with elegant Silvermoon-inspired options.  
  
In addition to Elven exteriors, players will be able to upgrade their houses to **Level 9**, with medium-sized exteriors unlocking at Level 8.

## Player Housing Charter Neighborhoods and Endeavors in Midnight Pre-Patch

As part of the upcoming full Player Housing launch, players now have access to Charter Neighborhoods and Endeavors.
- **Charter Neighborhoods** are neighborhoods that players can create within their own community, without requiring a guild or staying in a public neighborhood.
- **Endeavors** are special neighborhood events, in which players within a neighborhood join forces to complete tasks to change the visuals of their neighborhood and gain access to new décor.

## Training Grounds PvP Gamemode in Midnight Pre-Patch

Training Grounds is a new PvP Gamemode where players group up to play against non-player enemies (or bots). Taking inspiration from Comp Stomp, Training Grounds is a way for players to slowly introduce the fundamentals of PvP gameplay in World of Warcraft, without the threat of seasonal PvP veterans.  
  
Training Grounds also comes with its own set of unique achievements. Curious to experience WoW PvP on your own terms? Consider Training Grounds!

| 21 | Will currencies also be affected? Like undercoin being taken away or is this not until the very last moment prior to Expansion release on Feb 27, 2026?  \| 1 \| [Copcade](https://www.wowhead.com/user=Copcade) [13 days ago](https://www.wowhead.com/guide/midnight/#comments:id=6256397:reply=1812792) (Patch 11.2.7)  I'd like to know this as well. I can't find any info anywhere on coffer keys or undercoins in the prepatch. I'd like to use delves to test out class changes a bit. \| \| --- \| --- \| \| 0 \| [Salvesta](https://www.wowhead.com/user=Salvesta) [9 days ago](https://www.wowhead.com/guide/midnight/#comments:id=6256397:reply=1813566) (Patch 11.2.7)  I believe the current general understanding is seasonal currencies will not reset until the full release of midnight coming at the start of march \| |

| 9 | Coming from d4 to legion remix where you get new gear every millisecond, I was like, holy crap I can't believe they still don't have a transmog system in wow yet where appearances persist through changing gear. Crazy it took this long |

| 5 | We need more complete details about what will be removed in the pre-patch on the 20th. |

| 3 | Currencies will be taken away,upgrade system stays till release? m+ will be accessible? Appearance changed will be live? |

| 1 | Where is your source that confirms what comes out in Pre Patch and what doesn't? Obviously somethings have been said, but I've not seen a single blue post confirm Endeavors is coming in Prepatch. The only things that have been confirmed are DH and Devourer stuff. Pre Patch Event and Exteriors. Let's not forget how much was wrong in August. And how much we thought the Winter Veil Tree was going to be out in December but was also wrong.

| 1 | When they introducing the change where collection of an entire tier will unlock the appearance for the lower difficulties (i.e. collecting Mythic gear unlocks LFR, Normal, and Heroic)? And also, is it for every tier ever that has difficulty differences, or just for more recent expansions? |
| --- | --- |

| 1 | not sure if i missed anything in the article, but as of right now haranir are expected to be released with the general midnight launch?  \| 0 \| [avatarofshadow](https://www.wowhead.com/user=avatarofshadow) [<Rare Premium User>](https://www.wowhead.com/premium) [5 hr 41 min ago](https://www.wowhead.com/guide/midnight/#comments:id=6261836:reply=1815234) (Patch 11.2.7)  you have to be max level, which you can't do until March. \| \| --- \| --- \| |

| \-8 | New World Quests in the Twilight Highlands.  It would be cool to add these quests to all expansions starting with Classic. |
| --- | --- |

| \-15 | I wish we never had a stat squish or levels change in Shadowlands and not again here.      We should be 140-150 and 150-160 for TWW and Midnight, or since they are half-expansions, 140-145 and 145-150      Whenever there are stat squishes, it takes a while to be smooth again and everyone will feel the different immediately.      Also, players should have to complete a certain percentage of classic content and then each expansion, in order to move onto the next or start the new one. We are giving way too much away without players earning it.   Boosts, and remix nonsense rush rush rush to max level BS, and more.      If you don't want to play properly then don't play. We can't continue to make the game easier and faster, because the vocal minority will only get lazier and greedier and then the devs will continue to cave.   We give alts so much they never earned and that needs to stop. No one should be able to go from level 1-80 in less than 3 months if playing every single day for hours, and if they broke up the levels properly, players would need at least 1-2 years before reaching max level and going through all expansions.      I feel bad for new players that get this tiny experience of WoW instead of the proper experience. I'm just glad many choose to not use boosts or skip mode remix or anything else and want to experience the full game, as all should.  \| 0 \| [gannondworf13](https://www.wowhead.com/user=gannondworf13) [10 days ago](https://www.wowhead.com/guide/midnight/#comments:id=6258256:reply=1813334) (Patch 11.2.7)  Wow has so much content that isn't getting used much anymore. However, forcing people to do that is not the answer. Chromie time made it a lot better now that you can pick one expansion to level through instead of swapping every like 10 levels. There are some more things blizzard could do to make old content relevant but not required. \| \| --- \| --- \| \| 0 \| [Chintagious](https://www.wowhead.com/user=Chintagious) [<Rare Premium User>](https://www.wowhead.com/premium) [9 days ago](https://www.wowhead.com/guide/midnight/#comments:id=6258256:reply=1813464) (Patch 11.2.7)  WoW’s audience has grown up and now have other obligations like a job and family, and Blizzard is helping make sure people are able to see new content as it’s released. It’s intentionally not like classic. Respecting people’s time isn’t the same thing as being handed everything. Leveling for most people still takes hours, and when a substantial amount people may only have 1-2 hours a night to play, they’re able to make some tangible progress. It’s funny because that attitude is exactly why D4 was made the way it was on launch, and now they’re doing a 180 because people hated it lol \| |
