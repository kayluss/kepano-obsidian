Discusses neuroscience behind time tracking.
Movies mentioned [[Total Recall]] [[The Matrix]]

The brain has more than one clock in which they are buildt differently- Circadian does not have a seconds hand

[[Circadian Clock]] runs on [[Transcription translation auto-regulatory feedback loop]]
	Biomolecular mechanism track the Dna to Rna to protien cycle - oscillatory
The body needs to be able to tell time in order to start the protien proess

Clocks syncronize people - clocks are the catalyst for the [[Industrial Revolution]]
[[Mezzoscopic]] new word Neil compared it to Macroscopic but said mezzo is better aligned in this discussion as Mezzo means middle.
	That solidified where a [[Mezzosoprano]] sits in hierachy of Singing ranges.
