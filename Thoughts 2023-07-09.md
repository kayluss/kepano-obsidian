- Got to play Pubg with [[Tonya]] to get her a bit refreshed on the playstyle again. Had low back pain all day. Pain killers worked half the time. I watched all of the Witcher eps available
- I had a dream about WBW. I really hate dreaming because i usually still feel and remember them for months or even years. Especially ones where I have relationships with real life people that I never had a relationship with. IT makes things awkward in my head.
