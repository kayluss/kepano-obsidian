On the Outside looking in
The hell of the past is continuing
I see where I have been
Where I am going
I’ve left you within
The Circle of flames
Burnt to a sin.
You are stretched across
a shallow grave
Ashes blowing in the wind

No more will you be tormenting
No more will you leave me hurting
No more will you be absorbing
The Chaos
The confusion
The identity

I have bound and burned
The skin you used to cut
The heart you used to eat
The mind you used to fuck

The pain, the fire, the rebirth
Return to earth
The control I give
The feelings of you
I forsake
Within these words
Within myself
Strength I take 
So mote it be!
