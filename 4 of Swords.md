how appropriate again. I started my period yesterday. In July this card also  showed again near to my period. This cards talks about rest and contemplation, visioning building your future.  It can be a warning to not having anxious thoughts and to be gentle on yourself. I often have feelings of guilt with calling out of work during this time.
