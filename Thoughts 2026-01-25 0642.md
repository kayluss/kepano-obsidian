Last night some pipes like the shower drain and water line to the washer froze. It’s been double digits below zero for a few days know its expected. Pretty sure the same thing happened last year
[[Tanner]] had a shower and didn’t notice that the water wasnt draining. I figured it out when I noticed  water on the ground that looked like it came from nowhere. Me and my curiosity always leads to somewhere, not always somehwere I want to be.
