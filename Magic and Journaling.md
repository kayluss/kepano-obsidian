        - I love using prompts and cues because they allow me to visit a **predetermined thought-space** — A pattern of thinking that I want to engage with.
        - A journaling practice is the best way that I know to **direct and control your thinking**. **I think of it as intentionally installing a pattern of thought.**
        - Notes: These quotes are about [[journaling]] and not directly related to magic or a magical/spiritual practice, however, I believe it best expresses why one who is practicing [[magic]] should journal.  By setting yourself into a thought-space through journaling you are putting yourself into an energy mode. This is exactly what you are doing when you set your intention in a ritual or spell. 
        - Journaling is part of the long game of setting your mind and keeping your mind on path. When I talk about journaling am talking about writing things like whats on your mind, what you saw, dreamt how you feel, and reviewing past entries for connections/patterns, areas to improve and things/habits to let in the past.
