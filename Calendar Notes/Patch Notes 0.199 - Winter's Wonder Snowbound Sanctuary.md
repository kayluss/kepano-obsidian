## New Features & Updates

### Path of the Cardigan

![pathofcardigan](https://images.ctfassets.net/qyr5bjm559gz/5p4nM0TLinxRQGz5CeBBm5/466132fac89cc50fce19f463006f84fa/pathofcardigan.gif)

Step into the Path of the Cardigan. The Path of the Cardigan arrives wrapped in vintage charm and quiet comfort, expanding on the Lunar Path Journey with a new cozy-forward theme.

Introduced in our previous patch, Lunar Paths offer a relaxed way to earn rewards simply by spending time in Palia, with no expiration dates and no rush to finish. Progress carries forward at your own pace, with both free and premium rewards woven throughout each Path. You can swap between Paths and earn XP on any Path at any time. Just be sure to activate the Path that you want to progress.

Whether you’re tending crops, exploring Kilima, or checking in on your Daily Quests, every step brings you closer to new decor, cosmetics, and lasting account bonuses.

With Path of the Cardigan, settle in, take it slow, and enjoy the journey…this one’s meant to be worn in.

Here are a few of the items that are unlockable in The Path of the Cardigan:

- Cardigancore - Daring Daisy
- Mullet
- Sideburns #1
- Sideburns #2
- Cardigancore Jukebox
- … and more!

The Path of the Cardigan will consist of up to 14 levels of free and Premium rewards, and the Premium Upgrade will cost 1,000 Palia Coins.

### Lunar Path Improvements

Additionally, when you log in you’ll notice a few changes to Lunar Paths. Starting in Patch 0.199, you’ll be able to **earn Lunar XP simply by earning Skill XP** doing all of the activities you already love in Palia. This means those of you who want to grind out Path rewards separate from Dailies and Bundles will have that option - but things like Dailies and Bundles will still be the most efficient sources of Lunar XP.

With the addition of this new system, a percentage of your Skill XP earned will additionally be awarded as Lunar XP, applying directly to your active Path passively. You’ll also be able to track your progress directly on the HUD!

But we don’t want players to feel like grinding Lunar Paths needs to be a second job - so we’re also introducing a bonus system to help players catch up who don’t have as much time to spend: **Rest XP!** Every new Palia day (each real life hour), you’ll bank a certain amount of Rest XP which will multiply the Lunar XP from skills by 10x until it is used up. If you don’t use it, you can bank up to 24 hours of this bonus XP so that the next time you log in you can really catch up quickly. We think this will help make sure players of all commitment levels can earn rewards at a reasonable pace.

As part of adding these new sources of Lunar XP, we’re also embiggening all of the Lunar XP numbers - by 100x. For instance, Dailies and Bundles will now give 5,000 Lunar XP, and Path levels will take 10,000 Lunar XP to complete. All of your current progress with the Path of the Kitsuu will remain the same - just with these new values - so don’t be alarmed when you log in to find everything is bigger than you remember!

We’re still learning a lot about Lunar Paths, so please continue to provide feedback and expect further changes as time goes on. Right now, we’ll be monitoring the new Skill XP source to make sure it’s fair and fun. We especially have our eyes on Furniture Making and how it contributes to Lunar XP, but for now it works the same as every other skill, so try it out before we make any changes in a future patch.

### The Ferris Enters the Ranch

![ferris anh](https://images.ctfassets.net/qyr5bjm559gz/6BenE9kPeT3WsNggZCoaU0/736d0c83cf6551563c7630b421bb5f0c/ferris_anh.gif)

The Ferris is joining the ranch!

Formerly only known as just a pet, the Ferris is now a ranching animal that is unlocked at Ranching Level 12.

The Ferris produces fruit once per day, including blueberries, apples, and Piksii Berries, and has lower upkeep needs with hunger levels between a Peki and a Trufflet.

Get ready to welcome your tiny ranch helper with a knack for fruits!

### Hodari’s Starstone Search Event!

![HodariStarstoneSearch patchnotes](https://images.ctfassets.net/qyr5bjm559gz/36UNDYw7tJ8NO8EL5luLTo/ecdc7a6470d6af22dac531e387bd608c/HodariStarstoneSearch_patchnotes.png)

Grab those pickaxes and get ready to sparkle! Dig deep in the newest community event “Hodari’s Starstone Search”, running from **January 19th** to **January 26th**.

During this week-long event, players across Palia will mine together to reach a dazzling Starstone community goal. Whether you’re a mining pro or just discovering the thrill of uncovering gems, every Starstone adds to the glittering goal and makes Palia’s resident hunky Hodari Happy.

Join friends for Mining Parties, or chip away solo while still contributing to the total, and unlock tiered rewards including star-quality starstones, consumables, decorations, and other rewards, delivered straight to your News Inbox.

Follow milestone updates on Discord and social channels to celebrate each sparkling achievement along the way.

For more information surrounding the event and its rewards, you can [visit our blog post](https://palia.com/news/starstone-search "Starstone Search Event").

Hodari’s Starstone Search is a sparkling reminder that mining is better with friends…and maybe a little rugged inspiration!

### Snowy Skitterer Bundle

![SkitterReward](https://images.ctfassets.net/qyr5bjm559gz/Drw8kD3PjiuOEJ2suH7gN/5855faa3e3bdabbb1dcafa451b31b790/SkitterReward.gif)

Winter isn’t over yet, and that means it’s time to summon the elusive Snowy Skitterer!

You’ll need to help Elouisa gather a variety of requests to entice the Snowy Skitterer: cozy snowy decorations, glowing natural light sources, critters from your bug and fish collection, and the Snowy Skitterers favorite foods.

Check in with Elouisa to see if your offerings have worked, and in return for creating a welcoming winter space, you can expect new wallpapers and floors as a reward.

| Item | Loot / Craft / Purchase Location |
| --- | --- |
| Woodland Deco Wallpaper | Acquired from the Bulletin Board. |
| Desert Deco Wallpaper | Acquired from the Bulletin Board. |
| Eclectic Flooring | Acquired from the Bulletin Board. |

### Tint Tool Updates

![copyMode01](https://images.ctfassets.net/qyr5bjm559gz/7fxgf1msDeZm2SHhBCcoO5/c61894d05ad38dddfa313501fd0eee41/copyMode01.gif)

We’re expanding the tint system from Patch 0.198 with a brand-new feature: Copy Mode! Everything you could do in the previous tint update still works, but now you have a faster, easier way to apply colors across your decor.

There are two ways to enter Copy Mode: either select the new button in the Tint UI while in Placement Mode, or use a tint item from your hotbar to jump straight into Copy Mode.

Once in Copy Mode, you can select a color and run freely around your space, pointing at any tintable decor item to see a live preview. Confirm to instantly apply your chosen color, and watch your space bloom with color!

We’re also introducing two new tints. Read below for the list of the two newly added tints and their acquisition methods.

| Tint | Loot / Craft / Purchase Location |
| --- | --- |
| Leafy Green | Recipe Acquired via Skill Medals from Gardening Guild Store (Requires Gardening Skill Level 10). |
| Paddock | Recipe Acquired via Skill Medals from Ranching Guild Store (Requires Ranching Skill Level 10). |

Storage just got a little more organized.

Two new storage tabs have been added, including a dedicated tab for animal treats and a separate tab for stored tints. Both of these are accessible at the top of storage, next to the other icons.

Finding what you need should now be quicker and easier!

### New Snowy Decor!

Let it snow, let it snow, let it craft!

We're introducing new snowy versions of recipes you already know and love, building on the frosty additions from the last patch.

All of these are snowy variants of existing decor, and you must have learned their corresponding non-snowy version in order to have a chance to loot these recipes.

- Players can incorrectly open the Tint Options menu using hotkeys while already in Copy Tint mode, which may cause overlapping UI.
- Players are currently unable to enter Tint mode if they are actively highlighting an item while in placement mode.
- Interacting with fences while in Tint mode may incorrectly consume or cause a loss of crafting materials.
- The Estate Roof Connector currently has limited placement and will only snap to the sides of the Alchemist’s Cottage.
- Visiting players with "Visitor" or "Editor" permissions are not receiving a notification explaining they do not have permission to use Copy Tint mode.
- The Copy Tint mode interface is missing its background graphic, which may make the control instructions difficult to read.
- At some times of day it may be difficult to see changes made in the tint previewer.
- Follow pet animals with aura have less intensity than intended in the world environment.
