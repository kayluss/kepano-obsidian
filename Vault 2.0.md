# Purpose

Converted notes from archived vault system to this vault’s system 

# Usage, Terms, and Process
MOC -> Map of Content
[[Discord Inbox]] is a MOC not an Inbox	

### Questions
	
should I use [[weekly notes]] - answered Yes I will use weekly notes for to do list Not associated with individual projects

# Priority To Do

- [ ] Conver [[Current Fanfiction]] into a category and create notes for links listed. Next- Through the Hat
- [ ] Migrate MOC files over
- [ ] Migrate Menstruation tracker left off at 2017-02-13
- [ ] Migrate Bills ~~progressive~~ ~~spectrum~~
# Breadcrumbs to finish

     
# Troubleshoot solutions
Bases for categories 
	Problem: filtering for bills need to exclude the MOC. Had to insert a property on the MOC file that linked to itself and then create a filter where file does not link to. 
		Also using “created is not empty ” worked 
Daily Note Solutions
	Title needs to be date only or files won’t link to the imbedded base.
