# Troubleshoot solutions
Bases for categories 
	Problem: filtering for bills need to exclude the MOC. Had to insert a property on the MOC file that linked to itself and then create a filter where file does not link to. 
		Also using “created is not empty ” worked 
Daily Note Solutions
	Title needs to be date only or files won’t link to the imbedded base.
