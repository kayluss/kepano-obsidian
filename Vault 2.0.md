# Purpose
Converted notes from archived vault system to this vault’s system 

### Questions
	should I use [[weekly notes]] - answered Yes I will use weekly notes for to do list Not associated with individual projects

# Priority To Do
	- [ ] Conver [[Current Fanfiction]] into a category and create notes for links listed. Next- where this leaves us. 
	- [ ] Migrate MOC files over
	- [ ] Migrate Menstruation tracker
	- [ ] Migrate Bills
# Breadcrumbs to finish
	[[2020-10-15]]
	[[2020-10-09]]
	
	
# Troubleshoot solutions
	Bases for categories 
		Problem: filtering for bills need to exclude the MOC. Had to insert a property on the MOC file that linked to itself and then create a filter where file does not link to. 
		Also using created is not empty worked 
	Daily Note Solutions
		Title needs to be date only or files won’t link to the imbedded base.
