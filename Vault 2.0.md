# Purpose

Converted notes from archived vault system to this vault’s system 

# Usage, Terms, and Process
MOC -> Map of Content
[[Discord Inbox]] is a MOC not an Inbox	

### Questions
	
should I use [[weekly notes]] - answered Yes I will use weekly notes for to do list Not associated with individual projects

# Priority To Do

- [ ] Conver [[Current Fanfiction]] into a category and create notes for links listed. Next- Finished works
- [ ] Migrate MOC files over
- [x] Migrate Menstruation tracker left off at 2017-02-13  [completion:: 2026-02-16]
- [ ] Migrate Bills ~~progressive~~ ~~spectrum~~
# Breadcrumbs to finish

     
# Troubleshoot solutions
Bases for categories 
	Problem: filtering for bills need to exclude the MOC. Had to insert a property on the MOC file that linked to itself and then create a filter where file does not link to. 
		Also using “created is not empty ” worked 
Daily Note Solutions
	Title needs to be date only or files won’t link to the imbedded base.
Tasks to show from weekly note to master list. 
	tasks need to be created using ctrl + t and not be indented
