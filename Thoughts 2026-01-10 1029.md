Can’t get the other night out of my mind today. Have lots to do from photo printing for tomorrow to get noodle food, clean the cage, pick up Emmy. How is [[Tonya]] feeling since hearing about her Uncle. Is this tomorrow going to happen. 
Should I try a [[Linear Calendar]]
How much is too much [[coffee]] for me. I was only drinking two standardish cups 12oz i think, this week I’ve had 3 before going off to work. Three cups also happened once in  a while before this week. 
Fuck the M kink in my head still has quite a bit of shame attached to it.
Prody seems to be settling in really well. Playing with the toys in her cage, the top door we have been leaving open so that fed has more to explore. She is still not flying around yet. I think that’s good for us. Oh does she get loud about food you are eating and not sharing with her. Worse than the dog, maybe the dog is better trained.
