[[Sea Magic]] pg 12

Seawater Preparation
	“Mother Ocean, from whom life flows,
	Blessthis water with your love and nurturing power,
	Your endless beauty and strength.
	For this I am grateful.
	Blessed be.”

After each line dip into prepared water and then bless your crown chakra
“ A small wave for my smile,
A small wave for my Voice,
A small wave for my laughter,
A small wave for my Choice.
A small wave for my sight,
A small wave for my wealth,
A small wave for my generosity,
A small wave for my health.
A small wave for my truth;
Mother Ocean, I ask for nin waves of grace upone me.”
